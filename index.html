            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Household chores are more than just tasks—they are life lessons in disguise. From an early age, children
                who are encouraged to participate in chores develop essential skills like problem-solving, time management, and teamwork.
                Chore charts provide structure, ensuring tasks are age-appropriate and reinforcing positive habits. By integrating these tasks into
                daily routines, children learn the importance of accountability, fostering independence and a sense of achievement.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensorimotor Stage (Birth–2 years):</strong> Exposure to household activities sparks curiosity and sensory exploration.</li>
                <li><strong>Preoperational Stage (2–7 years):</strong> Simple tasks like tidying toys help children practice symbolic thinking and follow step-by-step instructions.</li>
                <li><strong>Concrete Operational Stage (7–11 years):</strong> Logical thinking develops as children understand how their chores impact the household.</li>
                <li><strong>Formal Operational Stage (12+ years):</strong> Teens begin to see the bigger picture, understanding the long-term benefits of contributing to the family and learning skills for independence.</li>
